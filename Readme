Our article is titled "Long short term memory and attention models for simulating urban densification"
This correspondence addresses urban densification
It presents a novel cellular automata model using a neural network approach that combines the Long short term memory,
the attention, and the neural network models
It is developed, calibrated, and verified for Belgium
Performance is compared with some state-of-the-art techniques
Google Colab was used for validation
The data will be given upon request
The file "mainmodel" describe the proposed LSTM-Attention CA model
