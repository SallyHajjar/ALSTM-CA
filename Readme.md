# Readme
Our article is titled "Long short term memory and attention models for simulating urban densification"
This correspondence addresses urban densification
It presents a novel cellular automata model using a neural network approach that combines the Long short term memory,
the attention, and the neural network models
It is developed, calibrated, and verified for Belgium
Performance is compared with some state-of-the-art techniques
The data will be given upon request
The file "mainmodel" describe the proposed LSTM-Attention CA model

## Installation
Google Colab was used for validation. Colab allows writing and executing arbitrary python code through the browser and is especially well suited to machine and deep learning.
More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.
## Data Pre-processing
We have used three (100x100) m raster-based built-up maps for 2000, 2010, and 2020 for Belgium. Moreover, 17 raster files, corresponding to different driving factors, are also pre-processed and used as inputs to our method. To process these datasets, we use the file called "Pre
